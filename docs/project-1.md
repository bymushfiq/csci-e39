# Project 1

## Purpose

This project teaches basics around working in a git-managed code repository, along with
common elements of a frontend application with UI built in React.

The project revolves around creating a photogallery, which requires the use of uploader inputs,
lists, images, text blocks, etc. The goal of this project is to get you comfortable within an
existing React codebase, and enable you to add features (whether simple frontend-only updates,
or more complicated ones that communicate with the backend).

## Instructions

Whether you had a different git flow or you've never worked with git before - this is a
lot. But, we're going to take it step by step and walk you through it. Learning how to
use git to contribute code is a big part of the process. Remember, there is the Slack
channel if you get stuck, and a whole lot of resources online. Because git and Github are
intended to drive collaboration, feel free to help each other. If you have a lot of experience
with Git, there's no better way to get even better than to help teach it to someone who is new
to it.

In order to complete Project 1, you will need to do the following (see [git documentation](./git.md) for git help):

1. Sync your local fork of the project ("origin") with our master repository ("upstream")
so you can work from the most current version of the app.
1. Create your own branch from the master branch of your updated local fork of the project
to track your code changes.
1. Use git to stage and commit your code changes as you work, creating a history of your
changes on your local environment.
1. Once you're done with your work on this project, push the changes from the branch on your
computer into your online fork ("origin") of the project on Github.
1. Create a pull request to submit the work you just did on your branch to the master branch.
